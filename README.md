## Overview

This repository contains code for a game of tic-tac-toe against an a.i. However,
in addition to the regular win condition of getting three in a row we added an 
additional rule in that players will flip a coin to determine who goes. Determined
at the beginning of the game, if players win, then they take their turn, lose however 
and the a.i will take the turn instead.
